# Real-time Facial Expression Detection with WebRTC

Deskripsi:
This project aims to develop a web-based facial expression detection model that is capable of recognizing and classifying human facial expressions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc. This project uses image processing and deep learning techniques by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as its model architecture. The dataset used is sourced from kaggle which was uploaded by JONATHAN OHEIX.
